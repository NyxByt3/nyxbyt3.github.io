<h2>About</h2>

<p>I go by the hacker name c0d3cr4f73r. I am a cybersecurity professional specializing in offensive security operations. My journey in cybersecurity began in 2016 when I started working as a Red Team Operator at the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry.</p>

<p>Since then, I have continued to expand my expertise, holding certifications such as OSCP, CRTP, CRTE, CRTO, CEH, eJPT, eCPTX, eCPPT, and eWAPTX. Currently, I serve as a Senior Red Team Operator for the Dubai Government, where I play a crucial role in assessing and fortifying the cybersecurity defenses of our systems.</p>

<p>Prior to this role, I worked at AIX Investment Group in Burj Khalifa, Dubai, further enriching my experience in offensive security operations. In addition to my professional endeavors, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and expertise with the cybersecurity community. Through blog posts, workshops, and speaking engagements, I aim to empower aspiring cybersecurity professionals and contribute to the advancement of the field.</p>
